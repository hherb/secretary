# NEXT_SESSION.md — desktop macOS Touch ID write re-auth (#277) ✅ BUILT (PR opens with this branch)

**Session date:** 2026-07-16, resuming from `main` @ `ebbc9c9f` (after #439/#440 merged). This session shipped **#277 (macOS half)** — Touch-ID-first write re-auth for the Tauri desktop client, with password as the universal fallback and a this-device kill-switch toggle. Branch `feature/desktop-biometric-reauth-277`; worktree `.worktrees/desktop-biometric-reauth-277`. Executed brainstorm → spec → plan → **subagent-driven development** (7 tasks, fresh implementer + task-reviewer per task, two Important findings fixed + re-reviewed mid-flight) → final whole-branch review (verdict READY TO MERGE after one MAJOR fix + 13 triaged minors, all fixed). Spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-desktop-biometric-reauth-277-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-desktop-biometric-reauth-277-design.md). Plan: [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-desktop-biometric-reauth-277.md](../superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-desktop-biometric-reauth-277.md).

**Pure desktop slice. No `core` / `ffi` / `ios` / `android` / on-disk-format change.** One new workspace crate (the only hand-rolled `unsafe` in the workspace), 3 new Tauri commands, frontend pre-step + settings toggle, README/ROADMAP rows.

## (1) What we shipped this session

### #277 (macOS) — Touch-ID-first write re-auth, 21 commits `acdc8ccd..ee080ce9`

- **`desktop/secretary-desktop-presence`** (new crate, `a4a7c9e0`+`3b3b0043`+`77e0b916`+`68347adb`): the isolated objc2 LocalAuthentication boundary. Omits `lints.workspace = true` so it alone may use `unsafe` (6 blocks, each single-expression + SAFETY-commented). Pure host-tested `classify(Result<(),i64>) -> PresenceOutcome` maps LAError codes fail-safe (unknown → `Unavailable` → password path, never through the gate); `evaluate()` bridges the async completion block to sync via mpsc; empty-reason guard prevents an `NSInvalidArgumentException` process abort. objc2 deps exact-pinned (`=0.6.4/=0.3.2/=0.3.2/=0.6.2`) matching the Tauri-resolved lockfile (single copy each). `classify` + LA constants + tests are `cfg(target_os = "macos")` — Linux CI compiles 0 tests for this crate **by design**.
- **Backend** (`0c9efabd`, `2682d4b6`+`9ba9d61b`): `authenticate_presence` command behind a `PresenceProvider` seam (vault-independent, `spawn_blocking` offload, outcomes are control-flow `Ok` — `AppError` only for faults); desktop-local per-vault pref at `<data_dir>/secretary-desktop/presence/<vault_uuid_hex>.json` (sibling of `devices/`, atomic tempfile-persist write, absent/corrupt → default ENABLED) with `read_presence_pref` (returns pref + hardware availability) / `write_presence_pref`; new `VaultSession::vault_uuid()` accessor.
- **Frontend** (`ff70cbbf`, `d10376ad`+`bc7ed1c3`): `authorizeWrite` biometric pre-step — pref OFF (or unloaded) → password only, biometry structurally unreachable; ON → Touch ID sheet; `authenticated` → clock advances no dialog; sheet's "Use Password" (`fallback`) / `unavailable` → the unchanged password dialog; `cancelled` → `ReauthCancelled`, clock NOT advanced (pinned by dedicated clock-semantics tests, all three arms). `presencePref` store loaded at unlock (fail-safe reset on load error), reset on lock. 3 commands classified in `writeCommands.ts` (#280 coverage green; `writePresencePref` lives in `ipc.ts` because the coverage layer-2 scan only reads `ipc.ts`).
- **Settings toggle** (`f7714acb`+`e0c93660`+`77c2358c`): "Use Touch ID on this Mac" (rendered + save-guarded on `availability === 'available'`), per-vault, this-device. **Enabling is security-reducing** and joins the `reducesProtection` re-auth gate (it cannot self-authorize — the gate reads the still-disabled store); disabling is a hardening, ungated. **The high-risk-travel kill switch: OFF → biometry never attempted.** The final review's one MAJOR was here: a Svelte `$effect` re-seed during the save's awaits clobbered the store mirror when settings + toggle changed in one Save — fixed by snapshotting `nextBiometric` pre-await (`77c2358c`, with a discriminating regression test).
- **Docs** (`00441ac5`, `65d08eb1`, `c65edf70`, `ee080ce9`): spec caught up (systemCancel row, `read_presence_pref` shape); ROADMAP **D.1.17** entry (renumbered — D.1.16 was already block-CRUD; heading now `D.1.1–D.1.17 ✅; D.1.18+ planned`); README Touch ID row + de-staled the password-reauth row's follow-up note.

**Security invariants (verified by the final review, hold end-to-end):** biometric is a presence proof only — password remains the sole KEK-knowledge proof and universal fallback; no path reaches a write without biometric-authenticated ∨ password-verified ∨ the by-design grace window; every fault/unknown outcome fail-safes to the password dialog; store default is safe-until-loaded and resets on every lock.

### Acceptance (all green at `ee080ce9`)
```bash
cd .worktrees/desktop-biometric-reauth-277
cargo test --release --workspace                                   # 1773 passed
cargo clippy --release --workspace --tests -- -D warnings          # clean
cargo clippy --release -p secretary-desktop-presence -- -D warnings # lib-only variant, clean
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --workspace         # clean
cd desktop && pnpm test                                            # 665/665
cd desktop && pnpm exec svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json    # 0 errors / 0 warnings
```
The deferred terminal acceptance — a signed macOS build authorizing a real write via Touch ID — is the on-hardware follow-up (below), mirroring iOS #202.

## (2) What's next

- **Follow-up issues FILED** (user-approved at ship): **[#442](https://github.com/hherb/secretary/issues/442)** on-hardware Touch ID proof (signed build; possibly `NSFaceIDUsageDescription`), **[#443](https://github.com/hherb/secretary/issues/443)** Linux fprintd/polkit provider, **[#444](https://github.com/hherb/secretary/issues/444)** Windows Hello provider.
- **#442 — on-hardware Touch ID proof** is the nearest-term follow-up: build a signed `SecretaryDesktop.app`, verify Touch-ID-authorizes-a-write, sheet's "Use Password" falls back, kill-switch forces password, unsigned-build failure mode documented. This machine has Touch ID (D.5 SE proof ran here).
- **#417 — mobile Trash purge-notice render-layer test** (verified OPEN this session's start) — iOS most tractable; also backfills #434's sheet.
- **#90 — Rust test-helper dedup** (~13 `copy_dir_recursive` copies; verified OPEN).
- **#437 follow-up — re-tune `macos-host` `timeout-minutes: 45`** once a few live runs exist.
- Any user-prioritized slice. **Verify liveness first** ([[project_secretary_stale_but_done_issues]]).

## (3) Open decisions and risks

- **On-hardware biometry is unproven** (by design, deferred): `cargo tauri dev` unsigned builds may fail `evaluatePolicy` (`LAErrorNotInteractive`-class); everything shipped is host-tested with a fake provider, and the objc2 binding surface was verified against docs.rs for the pinned versions. If the live sheet misbehaves, the funnel point is `secretary-desktop-presence/src/macos.rs` → `classify` — debug there, not in the frontend.
- **A vault-synced (cross-device) biometric policy** was explicitly deferred — it needs the vault-settings schema (`core`/`ffi`). The desktop-local toggle is per-machine on purpose (biometric trust is per-device; the travel kill switch is flipped on the at-risk laptop).
- **Never let biometry outrank password**: any future outcome mapping change must keep unknown → `Unavailable` (password), and the equal-clock-style invariant here is *cancelled never advances the reauth clock* — both are test-pinned; don't weaken the tests.
- **objc2 pins**: bump all four crates together (they're a version train); the pins deliberately match the Tauri-resolved lockfile so each resolves to a single copy.
- **Stale worktree cleanup done this session:** removed `macos-host-ci-437`, `ios-block-name-guard-269`, `d5-macos-native` (+ branches). Still in flight (parallel sessions — do NOT touch): `d4-browser-autofill`, `desktop-block-crud-ui`, `timer-poison-147`. This session leaves `.worktrees/desktop-biometric-reauth-277` — drop after the PR merges.
- **ROADMAP numbering:** Touch ID is **D.1.17** (D.1.16 was already block-CRUD 2026-06-20); heading bumped to `D.1.18+ planned`.

## (4) Exact commands to resume

```bash
cd /Users/hherb/src/secretary
git fetch --prune origin && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main
# After the PR merges, drop the branch + worktree (squash-merge leaves it "not fully merged"):
#   git worktree remove .worktrees/desktop-biometric-reauth-277 && git branch -D feature/desktop-biometric-reauth-277
#   (FIRST copy .worktrees/desktop-biometric-reauth-277/.superpowers/sdd/issue-*.md out if the follow-up issues aren't filed yet)
git worktree list && git status -s
# If resuming THIS branch for fixups (bind histories first — closes the add/add gap on the handoff doc):
#   cd .worktrees/desktop-biometric-reauth-277 && git fetch origin && git merge origin/main
# Local gates (fast subset):
#   cd .worktrees/desktop-biometric-reauth-277/desktop && pnpm test && pnpm exec svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json
#   cd .worktrees/desktop-biometric-reauth-277 && cargo test --release -p secretary-desktop -p secretary-desktop-presence
```

## (5) Handoff file model

`NEXT_SESSION.md` is a **relative symlink** to this file in `docs/handoffs/`. Authored once here; the symlink retargeted in the same commit on the feature branch (new path → no add/add conflict; `main` updates cleanly on merge). The handoff rides inside the PR — do **not** sync to `main` during the pause window ([[feedback_next_session_main_authoritative]]). If resuming this branch for fixups, first `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` (branch version wins on this doc) before editing.
