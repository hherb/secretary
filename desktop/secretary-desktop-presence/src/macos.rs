//! macOS Touch ID via LocalAuthentication. The ONLY `unsafe` in the codebase.
//!
//! Policy is `DeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics` (Touch ID only — never
//! the account passcode, which would muddy the "Use Password" fallback story).
//! Deliberately NOT `…WithBiometricsOrWatch`: an Apple Watch approval is a
//! weaker proximity proof than a fingerprint, so clamshell-mode users fall to
//! the password dialog for now — widening to Watch is a product decision
//! deferred to the on-hardware follow-up (#442), not an omission.
//! `evaluatePolicy:localizedReason:reply:` is asynchronous with a completion
//! block; we bridge it to a synchronous return over an mpsc channel so the
//! public `evaluate()` blocks until the outcome is known. The caller
//! (`authenticate_presence`) runs this off the async runtime via
//! `spawn_blocking`, so blocking here never stalls Tauri.
