Before we end, write a NEXT_SESSION.md containing: 
(1) what we shipped this session with commit SHAs, 
(2) what's next with concrete acceptance criteria, 
(3) any open decisions or risks, 
(4) the exact commands needed to resume (cd, branch, test command). 
Save it to docs/handoffs/ with today's date.
